## 📖 Introduction  
Our project focuses on developing a **Flutter-based mobile application** designed to identify butterfly species native to Gujarat. Combining state-of-the-art AI technologies with an intuitive mobile experience, the app provides:  
- **Real-time butterfly identification** through image segmentation and classification.  
- A **comprehensive catalog of 109 butterfly species** with detailed information on each.  
- Tools tailored for **researchers, enthusiasts, and conservationists** to promote biodiversity awareness and conservation efforts.

### Key Highlights  
- Utilizes **SAM (Segment Anything Model)** for precise image segmentation.  
- Achieves **85% classification accuracy** using a fine-tuned VGG-16 model.  
- Serves as an educational and practical tool for biodiversity studies.
